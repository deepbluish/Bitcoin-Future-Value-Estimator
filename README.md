Bitcoin-Future-Value-Estimator

Not investment advice, just a fun tool for curiousity.
This program calculates the future value of your Bitcoin portfolio.  The program is primitive in that the formula assumes that the price of BTC keeps 
incrementally moving up based on the amount of weeks until your sell date.  Yet, we have seen steady growth since the inception of bitcoin, so perhaps
this tools may be useful when applied to higher timeframes.
